# i3Dotfiles
This repository is just a place to keep Dotfiles for my Manjaro i3 installation. It's currently running in VirtualBox, so many of the defaults for things like polybar don't work as expected or at all. If (when) I replace KDE with i3, things will work better out of the box and I'll have more modules for things like CPU temperature. For the moment I've not strayed too far from the defaults so it's easier to make that move.

For polybar, I found EF - Tech Made Simple's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB008-FJ5o) very useful and it's the basis of my polybar setup.

For the moc player script and module I used a version from the [polybar-scripts](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts) repository. I used an older version as it has more functionality.

As you can see there isn't much here the moment, but beginners can use it as a basis for a more complex setup and hopefully there will be more to come.

Zsh and powerlevel10k scripts have now been added.

As always feel free to take what you need.
