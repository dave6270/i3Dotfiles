# i3Dotfiles
This repository is just a place to keep Dotfiles for my Manjaro i3 installation. Eventually I got round to installing i3 on metal - blame that on Manjaro KDE's rock solid stability - so I'm adding and changing config settings as I go, so it's very much a work in progress at the moment.

For polybar, I found EF - Tech Made Simple's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB008-FJ5o) very useful and it's the basis of upcoming my polybar setup.

For the moc player script and module I used a version from the [polybar-scripts](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts) repository. I used an older version as it has more functionality.

As you can see there isn't much here the moment, but beginners can use it as a basis for a more complex setup and hopefully there will be more to come.

As always feel free to take what you need.
